functional.analysis

This project is part of my PhD thesis providing a functional analysis of a 
whole DNA metagenomic dataset. 

The reads in this project were investigated for orfs and clustered by cd-hit. 
In following steps the resulted clusters were annotated by Pfam protein 
identifier, followed by a Gene Ontology  annotation. To visulaize the results 
a slim annotation of the Gene Ontology terms was used, making it possible to 
categorize the hundreds of GO terms into a maximum of 103 categories. 

The project itself provide all annotations steps, concerning the mapping of 
Gene Ontology terms and the corresponding slim annotion. Based on the phyloseq 
package for a taxonomical analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon data and a own 
developed method for determing a core microbiome the data will be visualized. 

This projects contains:
	- mapping of Gene Ontology terms to Pfam output data
	- provide a mapping functionality for categorization of 
	  Gene Ontology terms by a given slim annotation
	- conversion of the Gene Ontology data to a phyloseq object
	- visualization of the phyloseq object
